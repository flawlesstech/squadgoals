A tech conference for women, sans bullshit.

The tech industry can be wonderful, but also wildly inhospitable for women. We have to help ourselves up.

We are tired of going to pep rallies. We are tired of going to amateur magic shows. Corporate sponsorship should never allow lies and Brand "Truths" to co-opt this message. We don't have the time to waste.

So do women navigate the sausagewaters? By working, sharing ideas, learning, and growing together - and not by seeing ourselves and each other as obstacles. Let's be badass together. Let's sync minds, devices, cycles. ðŸ”´

Celebrate women and technology in New York this summer.

Men have to pay. ~ominous music~
