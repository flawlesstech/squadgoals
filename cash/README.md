## Women

I'm working to make it as free as possible for women to attend. There will be scholarships and funding available, even if the final conference ends up being paid.

## Men

All participants are expected to adhere to the Code of Conduct. Flawless is a safe space. Violators will be escorted out of the conference by Security and blackballed.

Select scholarship and volunteer opportunities are available to pre-screened men, especially students and new grad/Junior level men.
