## Women

I'm working to make it as free as possible for women to attend. There will be scholarships and funding available, even if the final conference ends up being paid.

## Men

All participants are expected to adhere to the Code of Conduct. Men will be escorted out of the conference by Security and blackballed.

Select scholarship and volunteer opportunities are available to pre-screened men, especially students and Junior level men.
